In what city and state were these two stores, and which store had a higher average daily revenue?--

--Q8: Divide the msa_income groups up so that msa_incomes between 1 and 20,000 are labeled 'low', msa_incomes between 20,001 and 30,000 are labeled 'med-low', msa_incomes between 30,001 and 40,000 are labeled 'med-high', and msa_incomes between 40,001 and 60,000 are labeled 'high'. Which of these groups has the highest average daily revenue (as defined in Teradata Week 5 Exercise Guide) per store?--
