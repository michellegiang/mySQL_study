--Q9: Divide stores up so that stores with msa populations between 1 and 100,000 are labeled 'very small', stores with msa populations between 100,001 and 200,000 are labeled 'small', stores with msa populations between 200,001 and 500,000 are labeled 'med_small', stores with msa populations between 500,001 and 1,000,000 are labeled 'med_large', stores with msa populations between 1,000,001 and 5,000,000 are labeled “large”, and stores with msa_population greater than 5,000,000 are labeled “very large”. What is the average daily revenue (as defined in Teradata Week 5 Exercise Guide) for a store in a “very large” population msa?--

--Q10: Which department in which store had the greatest percent increase in average daily sales revenue from November to December, and what city and state was that store located in? Only examine departments whose total sales were at least $1,000 in both November and December.--

--Q13: For each store, determine the month with the minimum average daily revenue (as defined in Teradata Week 5 Exercise Guide) . For each of the twelve months of the year, count how many stores' minimum average daily revenue was in that month. During which month(s) did over 100 stores have their minimum average daily revenue?--

--Q14: Write a query that determines the month in which each store had its maximum number of sku units returned. During which month did the greatest number of stores have their maximum number of sku units returned?--
